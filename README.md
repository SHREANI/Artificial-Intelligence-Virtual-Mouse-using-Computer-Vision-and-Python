# Artificial-Intelligence-Virtual-Mouse-using-Computer-Vision-and-Python
This project replaces the traditional physical mouse with an AI-powered virtual mouse controlled entirely through hand gestures using a standard webcam. It leverages computer vision and machine learning to detect and track hand movements in real time, allowing users to perform mouse operations without touching any hardware.
