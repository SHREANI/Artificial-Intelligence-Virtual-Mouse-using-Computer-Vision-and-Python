# Artificial-Intelligence-Virtual-Mouse-using-Computer-Vision-and-Python
This project replaces the traditional physical mouse with an AI-powered virtual mouse controlled entirely through hand gestures using a standard webcam. It leverages computer vision and machine learning to detect and track hand movements in real time, allowing users to perform mouse operations without touching any hardware.
ðŸ”¹ Features
Contactless Control â€“ Operate your computer without a physical mouse.
Real-Time Hand Tracking â€“ Uses OpenCV and MediaPipe for accurate hand landmark detection.
Gesture Recognition â€“ Specific gestures trigger mouse actions (e.g., index finger up = move cursor, pinch = click).
Cross-Platform â€“ Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
Customizable Gestures â€“ Easily modify code to add new controls.

ðŸ”¹ How It Works
Camera Feed Processing â€“ Captures live video from the webcam.
Hand Detection & Landmark Mapping â€“ Detects the hand and its key points using MediaPipe Hands.
Gesture Interpretation â€“ Maps detected gestures to mouse functions.
Mouse Control Execution â€“ Uses the PyAutoGUI library to perform actual cursor and click actions.

ðŸ”¹ Tech Stack
Python
OpenCV â€“ Image processing and video capture.
MediaPipe â€“ Hand tracking and landmark detection.
PyAutoGUI â€“ Simulating mouse actions.
NumPy â€“ Numerical operations for coordinate mapping.

ðŸ”¹ Applications
Touchless control for hygiene-sensitive environments.
Accessibility tool for people with mobility impairments.
Fun, interactive gesture-based interfaces for projects and presentations.
